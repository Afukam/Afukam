Hi I am afukam and I am enthusiastic about cybersecurity, coding, and volunteering, you can find me reading a book or staring at adorable animals when I'm not doing any of these things.

I have made use of resources to learn. I have completed over 70 rooms on TryHackMe with more than 105 days streak, and my area of focus is red teaming, and I haven't just used materials from TryHackMe; I have also used resources from netacad, HTB, YouTube, Microsoft Learn, PentesterLab etc.
I  write  so be sure to check my articles, and of course feel free to contribute to the discussion.
Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn via https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiafukamnanya-nwanonenyi. And check out my articles on medium https://medium.com/@afukam
